    "# Learning the Best Diabetes Medication\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we implement the Bayesian belief model from Chapter 4 to find the best Diabetes medication. The following inputs are needed to fully specify the statistical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `S0`: For every drug, we maintain a *belief* about its A1C reduction. The beliefs are modelled as a set of normal distributions (i.e., two parameters per drug) that evolve as we make observations. The initial belief is specified with a mean and standard deviation derived from, e.g., the efficacy of each drug over an entire population (many individuals).\n",
    "2. `mu_truth`: When simulating the model, the true (but unknown) value for the A1C reduction of every drug must be simulated as well. We do that by directly passing a `scipy.stats.uniform` object, from which the model can draw samples. Caution: The two arguments of `scipy.stats.uniform`, `loc` and `scale` are not the upper and lower bound, but the lower and upper bounds will be `[loc, loc+scale]`. It is also possible to select fixed values for `mu_truth`. In this case, select a uniform distribution where the lower and upper bound are equal. \n",
    "3. `sigma_W`: This is the standard deviation of an observation. Observations are sampled from a normal distribution with mean `mu_truth` and standard deviation `sigma_W`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a model where `mu_truth` is fixed, that means we have only one random process (observational uncertainty)."
